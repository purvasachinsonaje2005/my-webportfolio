        Hi! I’m Purva, a passionate Java developer and data enthusiast. I specialize in Java development, SQL, data analytics, and DevOps. 
        I enjoy building efficient and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. I have worked on projects like Spring Boot 
        web applications and interactive dashboards, and I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. I’m always eager to learn 
        new technologies and take on challenges. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
